# <h1 align='center' style='color:blue'> Credit Risk Modeling Project</h1>

## 1. Introduction

In the rapidly evolving landscape of financial services, accurate credit risk assessment is crucial for the success and stability of lending institutions. This project aims to develop a sophisticated credit risk model for Lauki Finance, a Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC) based in India, in partnership with AtliQ AI, a leading AI service provider.

The primary objective of this initiative is to create a robust credit scorecard system that categorizes loan applications into Poor, Average, Good, and Excellent categories, mirroring the widely recognized CIBIL scoring system. This model will enhance Lauki Finance's ability to make informed lending decisions, minimize default risks, and streamline their loan approval process.

## 2. Background

Lauki Finance, as an NBFC in India, faces the challenge of efficiently assessing credit risk in a competitive market. Traditional methods of credit assessment may be time-consuming and prone to inconsistencies. By partnering with AtliQ AI, Lauki Finance aims to leverage advanced machine learning techniques to improve their credit risk management capabilities.

The Indian financial sector, particularly the NBFC segment, has seen significant growth and technological adoption in recent years. This project aligns with the industry trend of using data-driven approaches to enhance decision-making processes and operational efficiency.

## 3. Project Objectives

The key objectives of this project are:

1. Develop a sophisticated credit risk model using Lauki Finance's historical loan data and default indicators.
2. Create a credit scorecard system that categorizes loan applications into Poor, Average, Good, and Excellent categories, similar to the CIBIL scoring system.
3. Build a user-friendly Streamlit interface for loan officers to input borrower information and obtain real-time predictions on default probabilities and credit ratings.
4. Implement monitoring tools to continuously evaluate and improve model performance.
5. Establish procedures for Straight Through Processing (STP) for high-confidence applications after a 2-month trial period.
6. Provide a highly explainable model that allows business stakeholders to interpret and suggest necessary adjustments.
7. Enhance Lauki Finance's overall credit risk management capabilities, potentially reducing default rates and improving operational efficiency.

## 10. Streamlit Application

The project includes a Streamlit-based web application that provides a user-friendly interface for loan officers to input borrower information and receive real-time predictions. The application uses the credit risk model to calculate the likelihood of default and assigns a credit rating based on the following categories:

- **Poor (300-629):** Deep Red
- **Average (630-689):** Yellow
- **Good (690-719):** Green
- **Excellent (720 and above):** Deep Green

### Instructions

1. **Input your details** in the fields provided on the web application.
2. **Click "Calculate Risk"** to see the credit risk assessment.
3. **Interpret the results** based on the color-coded metrics displayed.

## 11. Conclusion

This project will significantly enhance Lauki Finance's credit risk management capabilities, enabling more accurate and efficient lending decisions. By leveraging machine learning techniques and a user-friendly interface, the project aligns with the industry's best practices and the growing trend toward data-driven decision-making in financial services.
